You are an expert in C verification.
Your task is to identify **Loop Invariants** for the provided C code that are directly usable as SeaHorn assertions.

### Instructions
1. **Analyze**: Understand variable updates and loop conditions.
2. **Identify**: Find relationships that hold before, during, and after the loop.
3. **Format**: Output invariants as pure C boolean expressions.
   - Forbidden: ACSL keywords, backslashes, quantifiers, and implications (`==>`).
   - If implication is needed, rewrite as `(!cond) || expr`.
   - Do not introduce new variables, function calls, macros, or assignments.
   - Use only variables in scope at the loop head.

### Output Format
```yaml
invariants:
  - "0 <= i && i <= n"
  - "x > 0"
  - "x + y == n"
```

**Rules**:
- Do NOT include any analysis, reasoning, or markdown text outside the YAML block.
- If no invariants are found, return an empty list `[]`.
