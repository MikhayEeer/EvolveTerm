You are an expert in formal verification.
Your task is to identify **Loop Invariants** for the provided C code.

### Instructions
1. **Analyze**: Understand variable updates and loop conditions.
2. **Identify**: Find mathematical relationships between variables that hold true before, during, and after the loop.
3. **Format**: Output the result directly as a YAML object with a single key `invariants`.

### Output Format
```yaml
invariants:
  - "0 <= i && i <= n"
  - "x > 0"
  - "x + y == n"
```

**Rules**:
- Do NOT include any analysis, reasoning, or markdown text outside the YAML block.
- Output valid ACSL syntax for invariants.
- If no invariants are found, return an empty list `[]`.
