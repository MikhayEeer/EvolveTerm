You are an expert in formal verification.
Your task is to identify **Loop Invariants** for the provided C code.

### Instructions
1. **Analyze**: The input is a loop snippet only. Focus on variables updated in the loop body.
2. **Verify (Chain of Thought)**: 
   - **MUST** write a `Verification Analysis` section first.
   - For every candidate invariant (e.g., `x^2 + y^2 == c`), explicitly calculate the next state `x_new^2 + y_new^2`.
   - **Compare**: Does `new == old`? If not, discard it.
   - **Warning**: Do not assume conservation (e.g. rotation) without checking coefficients.
   - You may use up to 8192 tokens for the analysis.
3. **Format**: Output invariants in ACSL syntax.
4. Do NOT output the loop condition/guard verbatim as an invariant. If you use a related fact, make it stronger (e.g., bounds).
5. Do NOT output invariants that only mention variables not modified in the loop body and unrelated to loop progress.
6. Ignore LOOP\d:  A placeholder representing the inner loop, should ignored during analysis.
### Output Format
Output the result in **YAML** format with two keys: `analysis` and `invariants`.
- `analysis`: A block string containing your verification math.
- `invariants`: A list of strings, each being an ACSL invariant.

**Example Output**:
```yaml
analysis: |
  Verification Analysis
  R(x) = n - i
  ...
invariants:
  - "0 <= i && i <= n"
  - "x > 0"
  - "x + y == n"
```

Do NOT output the ranking function/variant yet. Focus ONLY on invariants.
