ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (j>0 && n>0) {\n  j--;k--;\n}"
  invariants:
  - n == \at(n, Pre)
  - j - k == \at(j - k, Pre)
  explanation: j is non-negative at loop entry (due to guard j > 0), strictly decreases
    by 1 each iteration, and is bounded below by 0. n is invariant and only acts as
    a static guard.
  ranking_function: j
