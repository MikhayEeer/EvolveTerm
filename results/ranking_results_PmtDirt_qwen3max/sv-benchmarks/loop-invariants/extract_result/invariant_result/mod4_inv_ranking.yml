- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (unknown_int()) {\n    x += 4;\n}"
  invariants:
  - x % 4 == \at(x % 4, LoopEntry)
  explanation: The loop variable x increases by 4 each iteration with no upper bound
    in the guard condition. Since the loop guard 'unknown_int()' does not depend on
    x (as per visible code), no non-negative integer-valued function over the program
    state can be shown to decrease strictly every iteration. Thus, no ranking function
    exists.
