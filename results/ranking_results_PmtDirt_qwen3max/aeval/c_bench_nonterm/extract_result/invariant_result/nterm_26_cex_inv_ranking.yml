  code: "while (x < n) {\n  if (m == 1) {\n    x = x + 1;\n  }\n  if (m == 0) {\n\
    \    n = n - 1;\n  }\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The difference n - x decreases by exactly 1 in every loop iteration,
    regardless of whether m is 0 or 1, and remains non-negative while the loop condition
    holds.
  ranking_function: n - x
