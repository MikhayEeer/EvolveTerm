ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (a > 1) {\n  if (a % 2 == 0) a = a / 2;\n}"
  invariants:
  - a >= 1
  explanation: Assuming a is a power of two (so always even while >1), a - 1 is a
    non-negative integer that strictly decreases by at least 1 in each iteration.
  ranking_function: a - 1
