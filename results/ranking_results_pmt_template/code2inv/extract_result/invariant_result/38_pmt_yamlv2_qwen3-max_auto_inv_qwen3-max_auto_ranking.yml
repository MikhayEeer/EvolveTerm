  code: "while (unknown()) {\n    if(c == n) {\n        c = 1;\n    }\n    else {\n\
    \        c = c + 1;\n    }\n}"
  invariants:
  - 1 <= c && c <= n
  - n >= 1
  explanation: Although the loop is non-terminating due to cyclic behavior of c, the
    simplest SVMRanker configuration is a single-phase nested-loop template (lnested
    with depth 1) as there's only one loop and no multi-phase structure.
