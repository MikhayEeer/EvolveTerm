  invariants:
  - x1 <= 0
  - x4 <= -1
  - x1 >= x4 + 1
  - x2 == x3
  - x4 <= x3
  explanation: The invariants suggest a nested dependency between x1 and x4 (x1 ≥
    x4 + 1, x4 ≤ -1), typical of nested loops. A lexicographic ranking function with
    two components (e.g., based on -x4 and -x1) is likely required, hence lnested
    with depth 2.
