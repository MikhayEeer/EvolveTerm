  code: "while (x < 0) {\n    x = x + z;\n    z = -2*y;\n    y = y + 1;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The loop's termination depends on the interplay between y (which increases)
    and x (which is updated via z = -2y). A lexicographic ranking function of depth
    2 is needed, likely using -y as the primary component (assuming y starts negative)
    and a function of x as secondary.
