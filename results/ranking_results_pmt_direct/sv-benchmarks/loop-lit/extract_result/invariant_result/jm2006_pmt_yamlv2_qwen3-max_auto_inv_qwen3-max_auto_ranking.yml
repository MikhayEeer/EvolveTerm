ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while(x != 0) {\n    x--;\n    y--;\n}"
  invariants:
  - x - y == \old(x) - \old(y)
  explanation: The variable x decreases by 1 each iteration and is bounded below by
    0 when the loop terminates. The loop guard x != 0 ensures that as long as x >
    0, the loop continues, and x serves as a valid ranking function.
  ranking_function: x
