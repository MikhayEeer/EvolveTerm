ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (unknown_int()) {\n  x += 2;\n}"
  invariants:
  - x % 2 == \at(x, Pre) % 2
  explanation: The loop guard 'unknown_int()' is independent of program state, and
    the only variable 'x' increases monotonically. No expression over program variables
    can serve as a ranking function because no such expression is both bounded below
    and strictly decreasing. The loop may not terminate.
  ranking_function: none
