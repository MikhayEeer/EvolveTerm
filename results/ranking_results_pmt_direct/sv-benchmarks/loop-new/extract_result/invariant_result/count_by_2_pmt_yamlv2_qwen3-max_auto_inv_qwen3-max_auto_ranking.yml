ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: for (i = 0; i < LARGE_INT; i += 2) ;
  invariants:
  - i >= 0
  - i % 2 == 0
  - i < LARGE_INT
  explanation: The expression LARGE_INT - i is non-negative while the loop condition
    holds and decreases by 2 each iteration, ensuring termination.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT - i
