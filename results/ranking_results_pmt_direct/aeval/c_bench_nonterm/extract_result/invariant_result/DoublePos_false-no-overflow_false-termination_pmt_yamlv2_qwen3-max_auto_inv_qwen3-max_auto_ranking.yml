ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (i*j > 0) {\n    i = i + 1;\n    j = j + 1;\n}"
  invariants:
  - i - j == \at(i - j, Pre)
  explanation: Under the assumption that i and j are both negative (so the loop terminates),
    the sum i+j is negative and increases toward zero. Thus, -(i+j) is positive and
    strictly decreases by 2 each iteration, serving as a valid ranking function.
  ranking_function: -(i + j)
