ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (x != 0) {\n    x = x - 2;\n}"
  invariants:
  - "(\at(x, Pre) - x) % 2 == 0"
  explanation: Assuming x is a non-negative even integer (as required for termination),
    x is always positive in the loop and decreases by 2 each iteration, making it
    a valid ranking function.
  ranking_function: x
