task: ranking_inference
ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: for (i = 0; i < LARGE_INT; i++) ;
  invariants:
  - i >= 0
  - i <= LARGE_INT
  explanation: The expression LARGE_INT - i is non-negative during loop execution
    and decreases by 1 in every iteration, ensuring termination.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT - i
