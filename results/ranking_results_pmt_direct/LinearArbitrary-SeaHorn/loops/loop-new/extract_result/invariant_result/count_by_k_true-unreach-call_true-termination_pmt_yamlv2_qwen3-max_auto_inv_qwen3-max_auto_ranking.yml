task: ranking_inference
ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: for (i = 0; i < LARGE_INT*k; i += k) ;
  invariants:
  - i >= 0
  - i <= LARGE_INT * k
  - k != 0 ==> i % k == 0
  explanation: The expression LARGE_INT * k - i is non-negative during loop execution
    and decreases by k (>0) each iteration, ensuring termination.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT * k - i
