ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (x != y)\n{\n  x = x - 3;\n  y = y - 1;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The difference x - y decreases by 2 each iteration. For terminating
    executions, x - y is always non-negative and even, ensuring the function is bounded
    below by 0 and strictly decreases.
  ranking_function: x - y
