ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (bob + samantha < 100) {\n    temp = bob;\n    bob = samantha;\n  \
    \  samantha = temp;\n}"
  invariants:
  - bob + samantha == \at(bob + samantha, Pre)
  explanation: This function is bounded below by 1 when the loop condition holds,
    but it remains constant across iterations due to the invariant bob + samantha
    == constant. Therefore, it does NOT strictly decrease, and no valid ranking function
    exists for this non-terminating loop.
  ranking_function: 100 - (bob + samantha)
