  code: "while(i < LARGE_INT) {\n    int j = unknown_int();\n    if (!(1 <= j && j\
    \ < LARGE_INT)) return 0;\n    i = i + j;\n    k ++;\n}"

  explanation: The loop variable i increases by at least 1 each iteration and is bounded
    above by LARGE_INT, so LARGE_INT - i is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases
    each iteration.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT - i
