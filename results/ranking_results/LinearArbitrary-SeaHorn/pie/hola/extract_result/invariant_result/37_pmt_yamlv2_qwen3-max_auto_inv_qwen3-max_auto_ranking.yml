ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while(x<n) {\n   if(unknown2()) {\n     m = x;\n   }\n   x= x+1;\n}"
  invariants:
  - x <= n
  explanation: The loop variable x increases by 1 each iteration until it reaches
    n; thus, n - x is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases each iteration.
  ranking_function: n - x
