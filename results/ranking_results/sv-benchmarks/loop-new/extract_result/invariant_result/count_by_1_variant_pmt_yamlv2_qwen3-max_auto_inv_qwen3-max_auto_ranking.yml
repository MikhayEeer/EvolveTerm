ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "for (i = 0; i != LARGE_INT; i++) {\n    {;\n//@ assert(i <= LARGE_INT);\n\
    }\n\n}"
  invariants:
  - 0 <= i
  - i <= LARGE_INT
  - 0 <= i && i <= LARGE_INT
  explanation: The expression LARGE_INT - i is non-negative and decreases by 1 in
    every iteration until i reaches LARGE_INT, ensuring termination.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT - i
