ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: for (i = 0; i < LARGE_INT; i++) ;
  invariants:
  - 0 <= i
  - i <= LARGE_INT
  - 0 <= i && i <= LARGE_INT
  explanation: The expression LARGE_INT - i is non-negative under the loop condition
    i < LARGE_INT and decreases by exactly 1 per iteration, ensuring termination.
  ranking_function: LARGE_INT - i
