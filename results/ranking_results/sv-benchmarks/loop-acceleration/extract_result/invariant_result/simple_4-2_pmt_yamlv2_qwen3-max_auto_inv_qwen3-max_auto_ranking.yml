ranking_results:
- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (x > 0) {\n  x -= 2;\n}"
  invariants:
  - x > 0
  - x <= \at(x, Pre)
  - x % 2 == \at(x, Pre) % 2
  explanation: 'The variable x itself serves as a ranking function: it is positive
    at loop entry and decreases by 2 each iteration, ensuring strict decrease and
    non-negativity during loop execution.'
  ranking_function: x
