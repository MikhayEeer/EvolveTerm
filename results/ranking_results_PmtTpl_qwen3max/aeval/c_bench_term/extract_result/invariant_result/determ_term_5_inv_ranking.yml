  code: "while (i != j) {\n    i = i + j - k;\n    j = j * 2;\n    k = k - 1;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The loop contains a variable (k) that decreases linearly each iteration,
    but other variables (j) grow exponentially, making a single linear ranking function
    unlikely. A lexicographic ranking function with two components (depth 2) is suggested
    to handle the interaction between decreasing k and growing j/i.
