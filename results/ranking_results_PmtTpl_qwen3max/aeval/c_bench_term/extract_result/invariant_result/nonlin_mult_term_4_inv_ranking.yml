- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (i >= j)\n{\n  i = i*d;\n  j = j*b;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The loop updates both i and j multiplicatively, and termination relies
    on their relative scaling. A single linear ranking function is unlikely; a lexicographic
    (multi-phase) linear function with two components is more appropriate to capture
    the coupled descent.
