  explanation: The loop uses a linear transformation that rotates and scales the state
    vector, causing 'a' to eventually become non-positive despite increasing norm.
    A single linear ranking function is insufficient, but a multi-phase (lexicographic)
    linear ranking function with depth 2 can capture the termination behavior.
