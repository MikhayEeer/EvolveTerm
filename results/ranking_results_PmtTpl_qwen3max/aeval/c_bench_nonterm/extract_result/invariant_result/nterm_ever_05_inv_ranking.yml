  code: "while (x < 1000)\n{\n  if (x != 777) x++;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The loop is a simple while loop with a single variable x that generally
    increases toward a fixed bound. A linear ranking function based on (1000 - x)
    suffices, so a depth-1 nested loop template is appropriate.
