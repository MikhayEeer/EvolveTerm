  explanation: The loop updates x based on modulo expressions of y and z, which increase
    each iteration. Although the loop appears non-terminating, if termination is assumed
    (e.g., under restricted initial states), a multi-phase ranking function may capture
    piecewise behavior across modulo cycles. Depth 2 allows modeling two distinct
    phases of variable evolution.
