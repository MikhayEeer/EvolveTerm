  explanation: 'The loop alternates between increasing a (by 2) and decreasing it
    (via division by 5 plus 1). A multi-phase ranking function with depth 2 captures
    the two distinct behaviors: one phase for the incrementing steps (measured by
    distance to next multiple of 5) and another for the decreasing step.'
