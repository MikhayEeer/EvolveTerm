- loop_id: 1
  code: "while (x > 0) {\n    x = x + x - y;\n    y = y + 1;\n}"
  invariants: []
  explanation: The loop's termination relies on y growing unboundedly, which eventually
    forces x to decrease. A 2-component lexicographic (nested) ranking function is
    needed to capture this behavior.
