You are an expert in formal verification and software model checking.
Your task is to identify **Loop Invariants** for the provided C code.

**Goal**: Find invariants that constrain the variables enough to eventually prove termination (i.e., establish bounds).

**Instructions**:
1. **Analyze Semantics**: Understand how variables change in the loop.
2. **Identify Bounds**: Look for variables that are bounded by constants or other variables (e.g., `i < n`, `x >= 0`).
3. **Identify Relations**: Look for relationships between variables that are preserved in every iteration (e.g., `x + y == constant`, `a <= b`).
4. **Use ACSL Syntax**: Express invariants using ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) syntax.
   - Use `\old(x)` or `\at(x, LoopEntry)` to refer to initial values if needed.
   - Use `==>`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, `\forall`, `\exists`.
5. **Format**: Output the invariants as a list of strings in a JSON array.

**Example Output**:
```json
[
  "0 <= i && i <= n",
  "x > 0",
  "y == \old(y) - i"
]
```

Do NOT output the ranking function/variant yet. Focus ONLY on invariants.
