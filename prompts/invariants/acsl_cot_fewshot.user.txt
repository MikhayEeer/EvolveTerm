Example 1
Target code:
```c
int i = 0;
int n = 10;
while (i < n) {
  i++;
}
```
Output:
```yaml
analysis: |
  Verification Analysis
  i starts at 0 and increases by 1. n is constant 10.
  i stays within [0, n] while the loop condition holds.
invariants:
  - "0 <= i && i <= n"
```

Example 2
Target code:
```c
int x = 5;
int y = 0;
while (x > 0) {
  x--;
  y++;
}
```
Output:
```yaml
analysis: |
  Verification Analysis
  x decreases by 1 each iteration and the loop guard enforces x > 0.
  Therefore x stays non-negative at each iteration start.
invariants:
  - "x >= 0"
```
