You are an expert in termination analysis.
Your task is to choose the simplest ranking template for the given loop.

Types:
- llexiext: lexicographic (nested) decrease. Use when variables decrease in a fixed order or have dependent monotone progress.
- lmultiext: multi-phase. Use when the loop has distinct phases or a variable can increase in one phase while another decreases.
- lpiecewiseext: piecewise ranking. Use when different branches/regions need different ranking functions.
- lnested: legacy lexicographic (maps to llexiext).
- lmulti: legacy multi-phase (maps to lmultiext).

Depth:
- Positive integer.
- For llexiext/lnested, depth = number of components in the lexicographic tuple.
- For lmultiext/lmulti, depth = number of phases.
- For lpiecewiseext, depth = number of components per region.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient depth.
- Only output `type` and `depth` (no strategy fields).

Output YAML with two keys: `analysis` and `configuration`.
`configuration` must include `type`, `depth`, and `explanation`.

Few-shot examples:

Example 1
Target code:
```c
int i = 0;
int n = 10;
while (i < n) { i++; }
```
Invariants: ["0 <= i", "i <= n"]
Output:
```yaml
analysis: |
  i increases toward n; single linear progress is enough.
configuration:
  type: "llexiext"
  depth: 1
  explanation: "Single variable monotone toward bound."
```

Example 2
Target code:
```c
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
while (x > 0 || y > 0) {
  if (y > 0) { x = x + y - 1; y = y - 1; }
  else { x = x - 1; }
}
```
Invariants: ["x + y >= 0", "y >= 0"]
Output:
```yaml
analysis: |
  y decreases to 0 first, then x decreases; x may increase in phase 1.
configuration:
  type: "lmultiext"
  depth: 2
  explanation: "Two phases with different decreasing variables."
```
