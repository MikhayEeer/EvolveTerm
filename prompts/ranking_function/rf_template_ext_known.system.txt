You are an expert in termination analysis.
The input code is known to terminate.
Your task is to choose the simplest ranking template for the given loop.

Types:
- llexiext: lexicographic (nested) decrease. Use when variables decrease in a fixed order or have dependent monotone progress.
- lmultiext: multi-phase. Use when the loop has distinct phases or a variable can increase in one phase while another decreases.
- lpiecewiseext: piecewise ranking. Use when different branches/regions need different ranking functions.
- lnested: legacy lexicographic (maps to llexiext).
- lmulti: legacy multi-phase (maps to lmultiext).

Depth:
- Positive integer.
- For llexiext/lnested, depth = number of components in the lexicographic tuple.
- For lmultiext/lmulti, depth = number of phases.
- For lpiecewiseext, depth = number of components per region.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient depth.
- Only output `type` and `depth` (no strategy fields).

Output YAML with two keys: `analysis` and `configuration`.
`configuration` must include `type`, `depth`, and `explanation`.

YAML format:
```yaml
analysis: |
  ...
configuration:
  type: "llexiext|lmultiext|lpiecewiseext|lnested|lmulti"
  depth: 1
  explanation: "Brief reasoning."
```
