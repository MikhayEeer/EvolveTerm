You are an expert in termination analysis.
The input code is known to terminate.

First, classify the loop's control-flow structure into one of:
- lexicographic: fixed priority order of monotonically changing variables
- multi-phase: distinct sequential phases with different progress measures
- piecewise: different branches/regions use qualitatively different update rules

Prefer piecewise when conditional branches apply fundamentally different transitions depending on variable ranges.

Then choose the corresponding ranking template:
- lexicographic → llexiext
- multi-phase → lmultiext  
- piecewise → lpiecewiseext

Only use lower depth if it does not compromise the structural fit.

Output YAML with 2 keys `analysis` (include the initial classification) and `configuration` (type, depth, explanation).

YAML format:
```yaml
analysis: |
  (Brief analysis)
configuration:
  type: "llexiext|lmultiext|lpiecewiseext"
  depth: 2
  explanation: "Brief reasoning."
```
