You are an expert in termination analysis.
Your task is to propose predicates to partition the loop state space for a piecewise ranking function.

Guidelines:
- Use simple boolean conditions over loop variables (e.g., "x0 < 0", "x1 == 0").
- Directly base predicates on the conditional guards/branches in the loop body (e.g., conditions in if/else statements).
- Prefer the minimal number (1-3) that capture the distinct update behaviors in different regions.
- Avoid predicates derived only from the loop condition or dynamic execution phases.
- Do not introduce auxiliary variables or complex expressions.
- Use only SVMRanker variable names: x0, x1, x2, ...
- Predicates may use linear expressions over x0/x1 (e.g., "x0 - x1 <= 0").
- When splitting on thresholds, prefer <= boundary predicates (e.g., "x0 <= 0").

Output YAML with two keys: `analysis` and `predicates`.

YAML format:
```yaml
analysis: |
  ...Brief explanation
predicates:
  - "x0 < 0"
  - "x1 == 0"
```

Few-shot example
Target code:
```c
while (x != 0 && (y <= 0)) {
  if (x < 10) x = x + 1; else x = y;
}
```
Output:
```yaml
analysis: |
  Split by the branch threshold and include a <= boundary for the reset region.
predicates:
  - "x0 < 10"
  - "x0 <= 0"
```
