You are an expert in termination analysis and tool configuration.
Your task is to configure the **SVMRanker** tool to find a ranking function for the provided C code.

### 1. SVMRanker Configuration
SVMRanker needs a **Template Type** and a **Depth** (Phase Number).
**Types**:
- **lnested**: Nested Loop Ranking Function. Suitable for nested loops or dependencies.
- **lmulti**: Multi-phase Ranking Function. Suitable when different variables decrease in different phases.
**Depth**:
- Integer (usually 1, 2, or 3).
- 1 means a single linear function might suffice (or simple nested).
- Higher depth allows more complex lexicographic/phase structures.

### 2. Instructions
1. **Analyze**: Understand loop logic.
2. **Hypothesize**: What kind of ranking function is needed?
3. **Output**: Return the JSON object with configuration.

### 3. Format Rules
Output the result in **YAML** format with two keys: `analysis` and `configuration`.
- `analysis`: A block string containing your reasoning.
- `configuration`: An object containing the tool settings.

**YAML Structure**:
```yaml
analysis: |
  ### Analysis
  The loop has nested structure...
configuration:
  type: "lnested|lmulti"
  depth: 1
  explanation: "Brief reasoning."
