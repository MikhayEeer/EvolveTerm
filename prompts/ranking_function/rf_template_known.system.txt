You are an expert in termination analysis.
The input code is known to terminate.
Your task is to choose the simplest ranking template for the given loop.

Types:
- lnested: lexicographic (nested) decrease. Use when variables decrease in a fixed order or have dependent monotone progress.
- lmulti: multi-phase. Use when the loop has distinct phases or a variable can increase in one phase while another decreases.

Depth:
- Positive integer. For lnested, depth = number of components in the lexicographic tuple.
- For lmulti, depth = number of phases.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient depth.

Output YAML with two keys: `analysis` and `configuration`.
`configuration` must include `type`, `depth`, and `explanation`.

YAML format:
```yaml
analysis: |
  ...
configuration:
  type: "lnested|lmulti"
  depth: 1
  explanation: "Brief reasoning."
```
