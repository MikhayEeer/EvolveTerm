You are an expert in program analysis.
Your task is to perform a **Preliminary Termination Assessment** for the provided C code.

### Goal
Determine if the loop is **Likely Terminating** or **Likely Non-Terminating**.
This is a heuristic check to guide downstream formal verification tools. You do NOT need to construct a full proof, but you must identify strong indicators.

### Instructions
1. **Heuristic Check**:
   - **Green Flags (Terminating)**: Simple counters (`i++`), strictly decreasing variables bounded by 0, standard `for` loops.
   - **Red Flags (Non-Terminating)**: `!=` conditions with step > 1, variables reset in loop, complex bitwise ops without clear direction, dependencies on external inputs without checks.
2. **Reference Comparison**:
   - Compare with provided `Reference cases`. If the code structure matches a known non-terminating pattern, flag it.

### Output Format
Output the result in **YAML** format with two keys: `analysis` and `prediction`.

**YAML Structure**:
```yaml
analysis: |
  ### Preliminary Analysis
  The loop uses a simple counter 'i' incrementing towards 'n'.
  No red flags found. Structure matches 'terminating' references.
prediction:
  label: "terminating" | "non-terminating" | "unknown"
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  reasoning: "Brief summary of the decision."
