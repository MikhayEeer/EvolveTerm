${code}
```

Output Requirements:
1. Focus exclusively on `for` and `while` loops.
2. Extract the FULL loop body, including nested loops and all statements inside.
3. Do NOT modify the code. Extract it exactly as it appears in the source.
4. Separate each loop construct with the delimiter: "---LOOP_SEPARATOR---"
5. Do NOT output JSON. Do NOT output markdown code fences. Just the raw code blocks separated by the delimiter.
6. If no loops are found, output: "NO_LOOPS_FOUND"
