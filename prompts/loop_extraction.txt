You are a precise program analysis assistant.
Your task is to extract all loop constructs from the provided C code for termination analysis.

Target code:
```c
${code}
```

Instructions:
1. **Identify Loops**: Locate all `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
2. **Extract Context**: For each loop, extract the **entire** loop structure, including:
   - The loop header (condition, initialization, update).
   - The full loop body with all nested statements.
   - Any immediately preceding variable initializations that are relevant to the loop condition (if they are adjacent).
3. **Format**:
   - Do NOT modify the code logic.
   - Separate each extracted loop with the delimiter: "---LOOP_SEPARATOR---"
   - Do NOT output JSON.
   - Do NOT wrap the output in markdown code fences (like ```c ... ```). Just output the raw code text.
4. **Empty Case**: If no loops are found, output exactly: "NO_LOOPS_FOUND"
