You are an expert in termination analysis.
Your task is to identify a **Ranking Function** (also known as a Loop Variant) for the provided C code.

**Definition**: A ranking function is a mathematical expression (usually mapping to non-negative integers) that:
1. **Strictly Decreases**: Its value decreases by at least 1 in every iteration of the loop.
2. **Bounded Below**: Its value is always non-negative (>= 0) as long as the loop condition holds.

**Instructions**:
1. **Analyze Code & Invariants**: Use the provided code and the previously identified invariants.
2. **Propose Variant**: Construct an expression involving the loop variables.
3. **Verify Properties**: Briefly check if it decreases and is bounded.
4. **Format**: Return a JSON object with the ranking function and a brief explanation.

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "ranking_function": "n - i",
  "explanation": "i increments by 1 in each step, and the loop condition is i < n, so n - i decreases and stays positive."
}
```

If no such function exists (i.e., the loop is non-terminating), set "ranking_function" to `null`.
