You are an expert in termination analysis.
Your task is to identify a **Ranking Function** (also known as a Loop Variant) for the provided C code.

**Definition**: A ranking function is a mathematical expression (usually mapping to non-negative integers) that:
1. **Strictly Decreases**: Its value decreases by at least 1 in every iteration of the loop.
2. **Bounded Below**: Its value is always non-negative (>= 0) as long as the loop condition holds.

**Instructions**:
1. **Analyze Code & Invariants**: Use the provided code and the previously identified invariants.
2. **Propose Variant**: Construct an expression involving the loop variables.
3. **Verify Properties**: Briefly check if it decreases and is bounded.
4. **STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT**: Return **only** a single JSON object (no code fences, no prose, no markdown) with two keys: `ranking_function` (string or null) and `explanation` (string). No additional text.

**JSON rules (must satisfy Python `json.loads`)**:
- Use double quotes for all JSON strings and keys.
- Use `null` for missing ranking function (not `"null"`).
- Do not output trailing commas.
- Do not output any backslash sequences that are not valid JSON escapes.
- Avoid apostrophes and contractions in `explanation` (write "do not" instead of "don't") to avoid invalid escapes like `\'`.
- Keep `explanation` short: 1 to 3 sentences, no newlines, and do not include any double quote characters.

**Ranking function format rules**:
- If you provide a ranking function, it must be a single-line expression over loop variables and integers.
- Allowed operators/functions: `+ - * / %`, parentheses, `abs(x)`, `min(a,b)`, `max(a,b)`.
- Do not use `^` for exponentiation; write `a*a` instead of `a^2`.
- If invariants are missing, inconsistent, or you cannot justify strict decrease and boundedness, return `ranking_function: null`.

**Example Output (only this JSON, nothing else)**:
{
  "ranking_function": "n - i",
  "explanation": "i increases by 1 each iteration and the loop condition is i < n, so n - i strictly decreases and stays non-negative while the loop runs."
}

If no such function exists (i.e., the loop is non-terminating), set `"ranking_function"` to `null` (still inside the JSON object).
